&lt;h2&gt;Fog Bow, Brocken Spectre, Glory and Shipwreck&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2013/08/fog-bow-brocken-spectre-glory-and-shipwreck.html&quot;&gt;EPOD 23 August 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo at top shows a spectacular 360 degree &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogbow.htm&quot;&gt;fogbow&lt;/a&gt;, a 360 degree solar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/glory.htm&quot;&gt;glory&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/globrock.htm&quot;&gt;Spectre of the Brocken&lt;/a&gt; as viewed from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goldengatebridge.org/research/facts.php&quot;&gt;Golden Gate Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, California. In order to see such a display the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/clouds.htm&quot;&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; layer needs to be below the observer and &lt;a href=&quot;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun&quot;&gt;the Sun&lt;/a&gt; should be positioned above him or her. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate&quot;&gt;Golden Gate Strait&lt;/a&gt; and Golden Gate Bay are both well known for their fog and are one of the best places in the world to see fog-related optical phenomena. Still, seeing the 360 degree fogbow, replete with a spectre shadow and glory, is a rare treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
yes,
us people are just poems
we&apos;re 90% metaphor
with a leanness of meaning
approaching hyper-distillation
and once upon a time
we were moonshine
rushing down the throat of a giraffe
yes, rushing down the long hallway
despite what the p.a. announcement says
yes, rushing down the long hall
down the long stairs
in a building so tall
that it will always be there
yes, it&apos;s part of a pair
there on the bow of noah&apos;s ark
the most prestigious couple
just kickin back parked
against a perfectly blue sky
on a morning beatific
in its indian summer breeze
on the day that america
fell to its knees
after strutting around for a century
without saying thank you
or please
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
and the shock was subsonic
and the smoke was deafening
between the setup and the punch line
cuz we were all on time for work that day
we all boarded that plane for to fly
and then while the fires were raging
we all climbed up on the window sill
and then we all held hands
and jumped into the sky
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
and every borough looked up when it heard the first blast
and then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed
and the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar
looked more like war than anything i&apos;ve seen so far
so far
so far
so fierce and ingenious
a poetic specter so far gone
that every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling
over &apos;oh my god&apos; and &apos;this is unbelievable&apos; and on and on
and i&apos;ll tell you what, while we&apos;re at it
you can keep the pentagon
keep the propaganda
keep each and every tv
that&apos;s been trying to convince me
to participate
in some prep school punk&apos;s plan to perpetuate retribution
perpetuate retribution
even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution
is still hanging in the air
and there&apos;s ash on our shoes
and there&apos;s ash in our hair
and there&apos;s a fine silt on every mantle
from hell&apos;s kitchen to brooklyn
and the streets are full of stories
sudden twists and near misses
and soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters
with tales of narrowly averted disasters
and the whiskey is flowin
like never before
as all over the country
folks just shake their heads
and pour
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
so here&apos;s a toast to all the folks that live in palestine, afghanistan,
iraq, el salvador
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
here&apos;s a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation
under the stone cold gaze of mt. rushmore
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
here&apos;s a toast to all those nurses and doctors
who daily provide women with a choice
who stand down a threat the size of oklahoma city
just to listen to a young woman&apos;s voice
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
here&apos;s a toast to all the folks on death row right now
awaiting the executioner&apos;s guillotine
who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads
to find peace in the form of a dream, peace in the form of a dream
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
cuz take away our playstations
and we are a third world nation
under the thumb of some blue blood royal son
who stole the oval office and that phony election
i mean
it don&apos;t take a weatherman
to look around and see the weather
jeb said he&apos;d deliver florida, folks
and boy did he ever
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
and we hold these truths to be self evident:
#1 george w. bush is not president
#2 america is not a true democracy
#3 the media is not fooling me
cuz i am a poem heeding hyper-distillation
i&apos;ve got no room for a lie so verbose
i&apos;m looking out over my whole human family
and i&apos;m raising my glass in a toast
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
here&apos;s to our last drink of fossil fuels
may we vow to get off of this sauce
shoo away the swarms of commuter planes
and find that train ticket we lost
cuz once upon a time the line followed the river
and peeked into all the backyards
and the laundry was waving
the graffiti was teasing us
from brick walls and bridges
we were rolling over ridges
through valleys
under stars
i dream of touring like duke ellington
in my own railroad car
i dream of waiting on the tall blonde wooden benches
in a grand station aglow with grace
and then standing out on the platform
and feeling the air on my face
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
give back the night its distant whistle
give the darkness back its soul
give the big oil companies the finger finally
and relearn how to rock-n-roll
yes, the lessons are all around us and the truth is waiting there
so it&apos;s time to pick through the rubble, clean the streets
and clear the air
get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand
of someone else&apos;s desert
put it back in its pants
and quit the hypocritical chants of
freedom forever
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
cuz when one lone phone rang
in two thousand and one
at ten after nine
on nine one one
which is the number we all called
when that lone phone rang right off the wall
right off our desk and down the long hall
down the long stairs
in a building so tall
that the whole world turned
just to watch it fall
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
and while we&apos;re at it
remember the first time around?
the bomb?
the ryder truck?
the parking garage?
the princess that didn&apos;t even feel the pea?
remember joking around in our apartment on avenue D?
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design
following a fantastical reversal of the new york skyline?!
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
it was a joke
at the time
and that was just a few years ago
so let the record show
that the FBI was all over that case
that the plot was obvious and in everybody&apos;s face
and scoping that scene
religiously
the CIA
or is it KGB?
committing countless crimes against humanity
with this kind of eventuality
as its excuse
for abuse after expensive abuse
and it didn&apos;t have a clue
look, another window to see through
way up here
on the 104th floor
look
another key
another door
10% literal
90% metaphor
3000 some poems disguised as people
on an almost too perfect day
must be more than pawns
in some asshole&apos;s passion play
so now it&apos;s your job
and it&apos;s my job
to make it that way
to make sure they didn&apos;t die in vain
sshhhhhh....
baby listen
hear the train?

&lt;h1&gt;Detroit Annie, hitchhiking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Judy Grahn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;white-space: pre&quot;&gt;
Her words pour out as if her throat were a broken
artery and her mind were cut-glass, carelessly handled.
You imagine her in a huge velvet hat with great
dangling black feathers,
but she shaves her head instead
and goes for three-day midnight walks.
Sometimes she goes down to the dock and dances
off the end of it, simply to prove her belief
that people who cannot walk on water
are phonies, or dead.
When she is cruel, she is very, very
cool and when she is kind she is lavish.
Fisherman think perhaps she&apos;s a fish, but they&apos;re all
fools. She figured out that the only way
to keep from being frozen was to
stay in motion, and long ago converted
most of her flesh into liquid. Now when she
smells danger, she spills herself all over,
like gasoline, and lights it.
She leaves the taste of salt and iron
under your tongue, but you dont mind
The common woman is as common
as the reddest wine.
