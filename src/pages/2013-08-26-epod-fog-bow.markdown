> ## Fog Bow, Brocken Spectre, Glory and Shipwreck

_From [EPOD 23 August 2013](http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2013/08/fog-bow-brocken-spectre-glory-and-shipwreck.html)_

> The photo at top shows a spectacular 360 degree [fogbow](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogbow.htm), a 360 degree solar [glory](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/glory.htm) and the [Spectre of the Brocken](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/globrock.htm) as viewed from the [Golden Gate Bridge](http://goldengatebridge.org/research/facts.php) in [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco), California. In order to see such a display the [fog](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/clouds.htm) layer needs to be below the observer and [the Sun](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun) should be positioned above him or her. [Golden Gate Strait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate) and Golden Gate Bay are both well known for their fog and are one of the best places in the world to see fog-related optical phenomena. Still, seeing the 360 degree fogbow, replete with a spectre shadow and glory, is a rare treat.
